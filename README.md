😷 AI-Powered Face Mask Detection with Deep Learning

🌍 Why This Project?

In a world where health and safety are paramount, AI-driven face mask detection is a game-changer! Whether in airports, workplaces, hospitals, or public spaces, this technology ensures compliance with health guidelines by detecting masked vs. unmasked faces in real time.

This project builds a powerful Deep Learning model to classify individuals as wearing a mask 😷 or not ❌ using Computer Vision. With potential applications in real-time surveillance, smart kiosks, and mobile apps, this system contributes to a safer and healthier future!

🗂 The Dataset

We used a diverse dataset of face images categorized into two classes:

✅ With Mask – Images of people correctly wearing face masks.

❌ Without Mask – Images of people without masks.

🔹 The dataset is preprocessed to ensure uniform size, quality, and balanced distribution.
